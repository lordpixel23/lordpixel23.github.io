      <h1>Bandcamp User Experience</h1>
      <p>Speaking as a music buyer, here is why I think Bandcamp's user experience is great</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Pricing is transparent and upfront</li>
          <li>Bandcamp remembers I always buy ALAC and defaults to that</li>
          <li>You can tip as much or as little as you want</li>
          <li>The shopping card lets you add items from multiple artists and labels, in a mix of dollars, pounds and euros then just check out</li>
          <li>Periodically Bandcamp has a day when it waives fees</li>
          <li>You can redownload anything you bought previously</li>
          <li>No special downloader application is needed, just use your browser</li>
          <li>Save your credit card info or not, choice is up to you</li>
          <li>Labels and artists both use the service</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h1>Nothing is perfect</h1>
      <ul>
          <li>Bandcamp used to require there always be a digital option but that seems to have ceased</li>
          <li>No Applepay support, only Paypal</li>
      </ul>
