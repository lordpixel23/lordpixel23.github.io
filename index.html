    <h1>Why</h1>
    <p>Why buy digital music?</p>
    <p>Streaming services are great. You can hear new things every day, you can find new music. But not everything is there. And I want to own music. I believe the artist gets more money and I want to know that music will still be there tomorrow.</p>
    <p>I worry if we do not keep buying music and movies then eventually renting will be the only option. And once that is true, the rents will rise.</p>
    <p>What I don't need though is physical media for most things. I have some CDs and records I love but for the most part it is just clutter. Better to have high quality digital files.
